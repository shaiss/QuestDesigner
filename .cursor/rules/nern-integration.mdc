# NERN Integration

## NERN Overview
- NERN is the bounty and milestone platform for NEAR Legion.
- All significant work should route through NERN.
- Proposals, bounties, and milestones are tracked on-chain.

## Proposal Requirements
- Ascendant rank requires at least one NERN proposal.
- Proposals must tie to vetted POCs from the catalog.
- Include clear milestones and deliverables.
- Reference specific prototyping needs.

## Bounty and Milestone Tracking
- Vanguard rank requires awarded bounty or accepted milestone.
- Evidence must include on-chain award or acceptance link.
- NERN status must be verifiable by reviewers.

## Mission Design Guidelines
- Design missions that naturally lead to NERN proposals.
- Ensure mission outcomes align with NERN bounty criteria.
- Create clear paths from mission completion to NERN submission.
- Track which missions generate NERN activity.

## Evidence Standards
- NERN proposal link required for Ascendant missions.
- On-chain award or milestone acceptance for Vanguard.
- NERN links must resolve and show correct status.
