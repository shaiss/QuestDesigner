# Mission Design Defaults

## When Unsure, Choose Defaults That:
1. Reduce review time.
2. Increase reuse potential.
3. Align with NEAR ecosystem standards.
4. Produce verifiable on-chain or public evidence.

## Evidence Defaults
- Prefer public repositories over private.
- Prefer on-chain transactions over off-chain logs.
- Prefer live demos over screenshots.
- Prefer automated tests over manual verification.

## Task Scope Defaults
- Prefer smaller, focused tasks over large monolithic ones.
- Prefer reusable modules over one-off demos.
- Prefer documented patterns over undocumented code.
- Prefer standard tools over custom scripts.

## Review Defaults
- Prefer binary acceptance criteria over subjective judgment.
- Prefer automated checks over manual inspection.
- Prefer single-command builds over multi-step processes.
- Prefer clear pass/fail over gradual scoring.

## Difficulty Defaults
- Start easier than you think necessary.
- Escalate difficulty gradually within each rank.
- Avoid sudden complexity jumps.
- Provide clear skill prerequisites.

## Integration Defaults
- Prefer official SDKs over custom implementations.
- Prefer documented APIs over undocumented endpoints.
- Prefer stable versions over bleeding edge.
- Prefer widely-used tools over niche alternatives.
